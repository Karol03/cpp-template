<h1>This is a simple template for a new C++ projects.</h1>
It inlcudes CMake, and bash script for fast building and testing. </br>
A big advantage is you don't have to back to the script directory each time, just run it and script figure out where it is and how to compile your project.

<h3>Run a project</h3>
For run a project just start the run script (use '-h' flag for more info)

<h3>Run the tests</h3>
For run the tests start the run script with flag '-t' (add optional '-g' flag to run the tests under GDB environement)

<h3>Rename the project</h3>
To rename project just change 'run.sh' file name. For example 'sample.sh' will generate an executable named 'sample' and a test executable named 'sample-test'
